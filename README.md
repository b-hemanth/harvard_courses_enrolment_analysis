## Why this Plot?
This plot might interest someone like President Bacow because it represents the biggest enrolment changes between Spring '18 and Spring '19. These changes are large enough to not be dismissed as random noise and represent changing interests. This could be useful in making various decisions on how to fund, provide resources for or hire faculty for different departments because it shows changing student interests between different disciplines and departments.
